        <h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
        <p>My personal projects are as important to me as my professional ones. My camera is usually involved with both.</p>
        
        <h3>Humane Society</h3>
        <p>Keeping Kids and Pets Safe- pictures of pets with Santa</p>
          
        <h3>Jewelry Photography</h3>
        <p>In 2012 and 2013 I learned to take pictures of high-end jewelry.</p>

        <h2 id="hobbies">For funsies</h2>
        
        <p>When I'm not doing that.. </p>
        
        <h3>I like to sleep in the woods.</h3>
        <p>I'll pack up my element with my gear and dogs, and start driving.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sometimes we go to state parks in Florida...</li>
          <li>Sometimes we go to state parks in Georgia... </li>
          <li>It doesn't really matter where we are as long as it's outside. </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>I like to brag about my dogs.</h3>
        <p>Some may say 'crazy dog lady,' but I don't care! I am crazy about my rescue pups.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Zoe is my lady dog. I usually call her 'Boo Boo.'</li>
          <li>Harvey is my buddy dog. When he's in trouble or being exceptionally <em>brilliant</em> I call him 'Harvard.'</li>
          <li>Their best friends are Oliver and Gertrude.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="fun-facts">Redic</h2>
        <h3>Listen, we're all a little crazy.</h3>
        <p>And that's fine. I actually think oddities are VITAL to the human experience. And good stories, of course. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>I once got tricked into flying a plane.</li>
          <li>My dogs have their own hashtags on Instagram and the Twitter.</li>
          <li>I went to a high school with prefects, just like Harry Potter.</li>
